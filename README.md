# Batcherbird landing page



i am working on a project called BatcherBird. It's an open source application to automate the sampling of synthesisers. Especially useful for making multi-samples from vintage synthesisers. 

I wanted a simple one-page website to act as a landing page and marketing page for the project. I asked Vercel's v0 to build something for me. it made this site which I think is NextJS. 

This might be overkill for a simple landing page. Maybe we can build a static site instead?

here's the info:# ðŸŽ¹ BatcherbirdProfessional auto-sampling tool for hardware synthesizersBatcherbird is an open-source alternative to commercial sampling tools like SampleRobot. Built with Rust and Tauri, it provides professional-grade batch sampling of hardware synthesizers with pristine audio quality.Batcherbird Screenshot## âœ¨ Features### ðŸŽµ Professional Audio Quality- 32-bit float WAV export (studio standard)- Sub-millisecond MIDI timing precision- Automatic release tail capture- Zero-dropout recording engine### ðŸŽ¹ Hardware Synthesizer Support- Auto-detects MIDI and audio interfaces- Tested with real hardware (Korg DW6000, Arturia MiniFuse)- MIDI panic for stuck note recovery- Professional timing and velocity control### ðŸš€ Batch Sampling- Range Recording: Sample entire octaves (C2-C6) automatically- Individual Notes: Precise single-note sampling- Progress Monitoring: Real-time feedback with note names- Persistent Streams: Ableton-style audio engine prevents corruption
